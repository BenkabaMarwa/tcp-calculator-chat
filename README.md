# TCP Calculator Chat

This project demonstrates a simple **TCP communication** between a **Client** and a **Server** in Python.  
It simulates the **TCP 3-way handshake** and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- TCP Handshake (SYN â†’ SYN-ACK â†’ ACK).
- Client sends an operation type and two numbers.
- Server performs the calculation and returns the result.
- Voice feedback using **pyttsx3**.
- Colored terminal output using **colorama**.
- Type `exit` to quit safely.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 colorama
